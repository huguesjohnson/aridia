#summary New features under consideration and comments on the feasibility/status of each.
*Map Editing* - Located where map data is in the ROM but it is compressed and the algorithm has not been reverse-engineered yet.

*Compressed Graphics* - Graphics that are uncompressed are currently editable in Aridia. The compression algorithm for the remaining graphics has not been reverse-engineered yet. Items to include for are: cut scenes, sprites, tiles, and portraits.

*Replace GYM files* - No clue how to do this yet.

*Event editing* - No clue how to do this yet.

*Treasure chest contents* - This seems like something that would be easy to track down but so far have not been able to find where this is located.

*Advanced enemy editing* - Name lookup, color palette, technique effectiveness.

*Create IPS patch* - In-progress, should be included in 2.0 release.
