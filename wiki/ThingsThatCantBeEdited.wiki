#summary Things in Phantasy Star III that can't be edited.
*Gems* – Since Gems can be equipped it seems logical that they would modify statistics. Nope, editing them has no effect in the game so they were removed from the weapons page.

*Adding items to initial inventory* – In the ROM, a character's techniques begin immediately after their inventory. Adding items causes their values to overflow into techniques, resulting in incredibly powerful techniques. In a save state, the empty item slots are filled with [00 00] but not in the ROM.

*Add/Remove individual techniques* – Aridia only supports modifying an entire technique group. However, it is possible to add/remove individual techniques within a group. Doing that causes the game to crash when you enter a technique redistribution shop. I wouldn't be surprised if other problems occurred too.
