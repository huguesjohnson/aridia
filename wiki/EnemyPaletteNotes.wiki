#summary Notes about how enemy palettes work

The palettes for enemies are stored from 201046 (31156 hex) to 206709 (32775 hex). The first 5 entries of each palette are reserved for the battle background and menu.

This allows four different enemy colors to be displayed onscreen at a single time. The limitation is that enemies can only have 11 colors.

In the VDP the palette entries map to:
#1 = bottom left enemy group
#2 = bottom right enemy group
#3 = top left enemy group
#4 = top right enemy group

Dark Force is the only exception found so far.
